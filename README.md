# Spare_Part_Inventory_Management
spare parts database streamlines inventory management, ensuring parts availability and secure data handling. It simplifies tracking, and order placement, and maintains records, enhancing efficiency and reducing errors in the motor car industry.


**Business Description**
There are numerous functional components to consider when it comes to motor cars that combine to form something you can use. Due to the complexity of each of these components, they might all work properly or improperly and have an impact on the overall performance of the cars. Each and every component is important since without even one, the entire vehicle might not function. Additionally, properly controlling the inventory of auto components might be a little expensive, which can be stressful and provide a lot of potential for error. The main idea of the project is to create a database for spare parts administration to manage records of the Spare Parts, Distributors, Billing, Engineering Teams, Warehouse and Vehicles situated in various regions, locations, with varied pricing allowing the working teams to place order, manage orders and store parts based on their needs.
Creating such a system will be helpful in the following ways:
• It's quite easy for the departments to manage the inventory without manually checking it.
• Also, it would be much more feasible to keep track of how many parts are being received and when the department should pre-order to be on track.
• The created database will hold records of demand and supply
• Since there would be no more manual entry and would be maintained by only one department it would ensure data security
• This will also allow us to maintain the history of all parts and distributors
For project/demo purposes we shall assume that all parts are readily available, and the inventory has certain stocks in it. Along with all active contracts with the distributors.

**Problem Statement**
A machine's broken part can be swapped out for a functional one using an automotive spare part. It is often kept as an inventory that may be utilized for upgrades or replacements on a variety of car parts.
Today all the parts information exists in the form of paper registered records as the industry is small-scale and manages to handle inputs in naïve methods and attempt to save costs. Searching, and managing these reports is difficult as the paper records must be stored carefully and to search for one part the employees must go through all records. This is not feasible in all cases as it’s a very tedious process to keep track of daily transactive data Also it is prone to data loss, and insecurity.
As they are paper records, they are prone to wear and tear and eventually loss of valuable data. Furthermore, due to many records, space issues arise.
This archaic system also makes it difficult for the manufacturing units to find availability in inventories for record storage. Also, manufacturers must be able to deduce connections between parts, inventories, and users and manage their finances. This results in a need for an effective and efficient Inventory Management system that can solve all the issues mentioned above.
Proposed Solution
We can guarantee a better user experience for all system users by developing an inventory management database system that allows for online communication and information sharing.
This system will make it simpler to store, manage, and retrieve data records, which will assist the administration in addressing all its problems. Additionally, it will address the issue of space loss brought on by physical records. Furthermore, the manufacturers will be able to locate and order parts.
It will help the distributors to track the records of the manufacturers as well as the inventory. They will be able to keep track of all the parts that have been exported, manage their billings with the company which also would help them to perform suitable analysis. The administrators of the company can query the system and find data according to their region, parts, and the departments. They can also check the capacity of the current inventory, which will help them to maintain the demand and supply.
Users
The end-to-end consumers of this product are the employees from the manufacturing plants, the Finance and Administration team, and Distributors of parts who’ll be using it for easier access to the inventories and invoice records.
To give a detailed description, the distributors will update information related to what parts are being exported and share their invoices with the team. The manufacturers will update inventory information and make orders along with finance management.
The administrative team can use this database management system to investigate the transactional records between manufacturers and distributors to ensure no dues are remaining.
